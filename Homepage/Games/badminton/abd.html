                    <p class="text">Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a
                        net. Although it 
                            may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one
                            player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
                            casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular
                            indoor
                            court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within
                            the
                            opposing side's half of the court.

                    <p>
                        <li>A game can take place with either two (singles) or four (doubles) players.</li>
                        <li>An official match has to be played indoors on the proper court dimensions. The
                            dimensions are 6.1m by 13.4m, 
                                The net is situated through the middle of the court and is set at 1.55m.</li>
                        <li>To score a point the shuttlecock must hit within the parameters of the
                            opponents court.</li>
                        <li>If the shuttlecock hits the net or lands out then a point is awarded to your
                            opponent.</li>
                        <li>Players must serve diagonally across the net to their opponent. As points are
                            won then serving stations move
                            from one side to the other.</li>
                        <li>A serve must be hit underarm and below the servers waist. No overarm serves are
                            allowed.</li>
                        <li>Each game will start with a toss to determine which player will serve first and
                            which side of the court the
                            opponent would like to start from.</li>
                        <li>Once the shuttlecock is ‘live’ then a player may move around the court as they
                            wish. They are permitted to hit
                            the shuttlecock from out of the playing area.</li>
                        <li>If a player touches the net with any part of their body or racket then it is
                            deemed a fault and their opponent
                            receives the point.</li>
                        <li>A fault is also called if a player deliberately distracts their opponent, the
                            shuttlecock is caught in the racket then
                            flung, the shuttlecock is hit twice or if the player continues to infract with the laws of
                            badminton.</li>
                        <li>Each game is umpired by a referee on a high chair who overlooks the game. There
                            are also line judges who
                            monitor if the shuttlecock lands in or not.</li>
                        <li>To win a game you must reach 21 points before your opponent.</li>

                        <li >Contact Fouls<br>

                            When it comes to contact fouls, they can occur anytime a shuttlecock comes
                            in contact with any object or person other than your racket.</li>
                        <li >Service Faults<br>

                            Also known as service faults, these tend to occur when a player is serving. If
                                the service is not executed below the waist or in an upward motion, this type
                                of foul can be called.</li>
                        <li >Double Hit Fouls<br>

                            Any attempts at hitting the shuttlecock a second time in a row are known as a
                            double-hit foul. Once you hit it once, that is all you are allowed.</li>
                        <li >Over the Net Fouls<br>

                            Most will associate this type of foul with players touching the net. No part of
                            your body or racket should touch the net at any point in the match.</li>
                        <li >Service Receiving Faults<br>

                            The first thing to avoid doing is moving before your opponent has made their
                            serve. Another thing to avoid doing is any distraction.</li>
