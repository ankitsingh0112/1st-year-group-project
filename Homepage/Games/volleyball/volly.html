                    <p class="text">Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.
                        Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized
                        rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo
                        1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996. The adapted version
                        of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

                    <p>
                        <li >Each team consist of 6 players and 6 substitutes. Players can be substituted at
                            any
                            time but if they are to return can only be swapped for the player that replaced
                            them.</li>
                        <li >The court is of a rectangular shape and measures 18m x 9m. Running across the
                            court is a 2.43m high net with the ball measuring 8 inches in diameter and
                            weighing between 9 and 10 ounces..</li>
                        <li >To score a point the ball must hit the ground within the outlined section in
                            your
                            opponents half. You can also score a point by your opponent failing to hit the
                            outlined section within your half or your opponent hitting the ball into the net. A
                            point can be scored off either teams serve.</li>
                        <li >Each team can hit the ball up to three times before the ball must be returned.
                            The
                            defensive team can then try and block or return the ball again hitting it a
                            maximum of three times.</li>
                        <li >Previously, once the ball hits a body part below the waist it was deemed out of
                            play and a point was awarded to the opposite team. But not anymore ,a rule
                            change now permits the use of any body part to contact and hit the ball.
                            Therefore, the ball can be struck by a playerâ€™s foot and still be in play</li>
                        <li >Games are played up to 25 points and must be won by 2 clear points.</li>
                        <li >Each game will start with a toss to determine which player will serve first and
                            which side of the court the
                            opponent would like to start from.</li>

                            and still goes over the net then this is perfectly legal).</li>

                        <li >Over the Net Fouls<br>

                            Most will associate this type of foul with players touching the net. No part of
                            your body or racket should touch the net at any point in the match.</li>
                        <li >Players must not touch the net with any part of the body. If the net is
                            said to have hit them rather than vice-versa, then this is ok.</li>
                        <li >The ball cannot travel under the net.</li>
                        <li >Players cannot reach over the net and hit the ball.</li>
