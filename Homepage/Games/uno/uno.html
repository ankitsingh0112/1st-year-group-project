                    <p class="text">UNO is a multi-player card game in which the objective is to
                        be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand. Each
                        player is dealt 7 cards and players take turn drawing cards from
                        the deck.

                        <li >The deck consists of 108 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four", and 25
                            each of four colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two
                            each of 1 through 9, and two each of "Skip", "Draw Two", and "Reverse". These
                            last three types are known as "action cards".</li>

                            The next player must draw 2 cards and forfeit the turn.</li>
                        <li >Reverse Card

                            The direction of play is reversed.</li>
                        <li >Skip Card

                            The next player loses his/her turn and is "skipped".</li>

                        <li >Shuffle the cards and deal 7 cards to each player.</li>
                        <li >Put the rest of the Uno cards in the center of the table. Keep the cards face
                            down in a stack. These cards will make the draw pile which players will
                            take from throughout the game.</li>
                        <li >Turn over the top card from the draw pile to start the game. Place the top
                            card from the draw pile next to the draw pile, but leave it facing up. You'll
                            use this card to start the game and it will become the discard pile.</li>
                        <li >Play a card to match the color, number, or symbol on the card.</li>
                        <li >Draw a card from the draw pile if you can't play a card. If it's your turn and
                            you don't have any cards that match the color, number, or symbol on the
                            top card, take a card from the draw pile to add to your hand. You can play
                            this card immediately if it matches some aspect of the card on the table.</li>
                        <li >Say Uno if you only have 1 card left. Keep taking turns until 1 player has
                        just 1 card left in their hand. At that point, the player must say Uno or
                        they will be penalized if another player calls them out.</li>
                        <li >Play your last card to win the hand.</li>
